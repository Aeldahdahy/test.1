        </p>
        <h1>Problem statement.</h1>
        <p>
            The problem with the current online investment system is that it lacks user-friendly features and fails to provide a seamless and secure experience for investors. Users often encounter difficulties in navigating through complex interfaces, making it challenging for them to access relevant investment information and execute transactions efficiently. Additionally, the existing system faces security vulnerabilities, making investors hesitant to trust it with their financial data and transactions. These limitations hinder the growth and adoption of online investment platforms, as users are left unsatisfied with the overall user experience and lack confidence in the system's reliability. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an improved online investment system that prioritizes user-friendliness, security, and seamless functionality to enhance the investment experience for individuals and encourage broader participation in online investing. 
        </p>
        <h1>Issues.</h1>
        <p>
            The online investment system faces several critical issues that hinder its effectiveness and adoption. Firstly, there is a lack of transparency in terms of investment options and their associated risks. Many platforms fail to provide comprehensive and easily understandable information about investment products, leaving investors unsure about where to invest their money. This lack of transparency creates a significant barrier to entry for novice investors and undermines trust in the system.
            Secondly, the online investment system often struggles with security and privacy concerns. Instances of data breaches and hacking attempts have raised doubts about the safety of personal and financial information stored on these platforms. Investors are understandably reluctant to provide sensitive data, hindering the growth of online investing.  
           Thirdly, usability and user experience are major pain points in many online investment systems. Cumbersome navigation, complex interfaces, and a lack of intuitive tools make it difficult for users to efficiently manage their investments. This leads to frustration and a suboptimal experience, discouraging users from fully engaging with the system. 
           Furthermore, customer support and communication channels are often inadequate, leaving investors with limited assistance and guidance. When issues or questions arise, the lack of accessible support exacerbates the frustration and may result in investors making uninformed decisions or abandoning the platform altogether. 
           To overcome these challenges, it is crucial to address the transparency gap, prioritize robust security measures, enhance user experience through intuitive interfaces and tools, and provide comprehensive customer support. By tackling these issues, the online investment system can foster trust, encourage broader participation, and empower investors to make informed decisions in a secure and user-friendly environment. 
        </p>
        <h1>System scope:</h1>
        <h3>1- System objective.</h3>

The system aims to empower users by offering transparent and comprehensive information about investment options, including risks and potential returns, enabling them to make informed decisions aligned with their financial goals. 
            Another objective is to prioritize the security and privacy of users' personal and financial information. The system should implement robust security measures, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to safeguard data from unauthorized access and potential breaches. By instilling confidence in users regarding the system's security, the objective is to encourage wider adoption of online investing and attract a larger pool of investors. 
            Furthermore, the online investment system seeks to enhance the user experience by providing intuitive interfaces, easy-to-use tools, and seamless navigation. By streamlining processes and eliminating complexities, the objective is to make investing more accessible, especially for novice investors who may be hesitant due to the perceived difficulty of the process. 
            Additionally, the system aims to offer comprehensive customer support services, including responsive communication channels and knowledgeable assistance.

Users can access a variety of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs, giving them the ability to build a well-rounded investment portfolio tailored to their risk tolerance and financial goals. The system often provides research tools and educational resources, enabling users to make informed investment decisions and potentially enhance their returns. 
            Another significant benefit is the transparency and information availability. The online investment system offers comprehensive and up-to-date information about investment products, including historical performance, fees, and associated risks. This transparency empowers users to evaluate investment options more effectively and make well-informed decisions. 
            Additionally, the online investment system often provides cost advantages compared to traditional investment methods. With lower transaction fees and expense ratios, users can save on costs associated with their investment activities. This cost efficiency is particularly attractive to investors looking to maximize their returns and minimize expenses. 
            Moreover, the online investment system typically offers robust security measures to protect users' personal and financial information. Encryption, secure data storage, and authentication protocols are implemented to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This commitment to security helps instill trust and confidence in users, ensuring the safety of their sensitive information.
